JS having two types of import 
common js and module
    // In module.js
    const myDefaultValue = "Hello";
    export default myDefaultValue;

    // In anotherFile.js
    import customName from './module.js';

go to package.json 
  "type": "module"

nodemon it automatically restart the server without being failed
 Why? ===> when run in npm run dev or start it runs but problem is
           when you make any changes in code it doesn't reflect the change 
           to reflect it you need to restart the project, the solution for this is 
           nodemon

nodemon install two ways:
 dependency and dev dependency
    dev dependency ---> used for development not in produciton

sahil@Sahil MINGW64 ~/Desktop/BackEnd/Project
$ npm i -D nodemon

see in package.json 
 "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.10"
 }

Now, go to scripts in package.json
    edit it 
    from : 
        "scripts": {
            "test": "bla bla bla"
        }
    to : 
        "scripts": {
            "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
         }

sahil@Sahil MINGW64 ~/Desktop/BackEnd/Project
$ npm i -D prettier
It helps for team to build projects on same platform it is plugin 

For data base connection go to 
mongo db atlas (atlas is a sub service provided by mongo db which provide online db)

sahil@Sahil MINGW64 ~/Desktop/BackEnd/Project (main)
$ npm i mongoose express dotenv

Sometimes Problems happen in data base so 2 approaches:
 1. wrap the db in try catch or promise (resolve or reject)
 2. Require time use async wait
